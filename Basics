AI And ML:
AI an ability where a machine can learn and think themselves.
ML a brach of AI where it makes a machine to leran fron data, pattern and predictions.
3 stages of AI: Neutral AI, General AI and Super AI.
Neutral AI: It performs only specific tasks. Eg: language translation, Self Driving Cars
General AI: It perforns autonomouse tasks similar to a person, research are going on this AI.
Super AI: It performs otstanding human tasks such as: creativity, problem solving and learning.
AI based on Functionality: 
Reactive Machines AI: It is a AI, holds little amount of m/y to react to inputs and outputs, does not posses cognitive ability of human.
Limited AI: uses AI algorithm to use prior data to come up with real time decision. It store important information in its memory buffer and uses that knowledge to make fresh judgements on frsh inputs.
 Efficient and cost effective way to learn from largest data set without storing and processing Data.
